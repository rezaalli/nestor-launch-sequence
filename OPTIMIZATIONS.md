# Performance & Accessibility Optimizations

This document outlines the performance and accessibility improvements implemented in the Nestor health application.

## 1. Data Fetching Optimizations

### Implementation Details
- Created custom hook `useDataFetching` for optimized data fetching with pagination and caching
- Added memory caching with configurable cache duration to reduce API calls
- Implemented proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and state updates on unmounted components
- Added error handling with retry functionality for improved user experience

### Benefits
- Reduced API calls through effective caching
- Better performance with paginated data loading, especially for large datasets
- Improved error recovery with dedicated UI and retry mechanisms
- Proper memory management through cleanup functions

### Usage Example
```tsx
const {
  data: activityData,
  isLoading: activitiesLoading,
  error: activitiesError,
  refresh: refreshActivities,
  loadMore,
  hasMore
} = useDataFetching<Activity>(
  (page, pageSize) => fetchActivities(page, pageSize, currentDate),
  {
    pageSize: 10,
    cacheKey: `activities-${format(currentDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd')}`,
    cacheDuration: 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
  }
);
```

## 2. React.lazy for Code Splitting

### Implementation Details
- Implemented `React.lazy` for modal components to reduce initial bundle size
- Created higher-order component `withSuspense` to simplify lazy loading
- Added fallback loading UI for better user experience during component loading

### Benefits
- Reduced initial page load time by deferring non-critical component loading
- Smaller main bundle size
- Better performance for users with slower connections

### Usage Example
```tsx
// Lazy-loaded component definition
export const LazyAddMealModalWrapper = React.lazy(() => import('./AddMealModalWrapper'));

// With HOC for easy use
export const SuspendedAddMealModalWrapper = withSuspense(LazyAddMealModalWrapper);

// In component:
{showAddMealModal && (
  <SuspendedAddMealModalWrapper 
    onClose={() => setShowAddMealModal(false)}
  />
)}
```

## 3. Error Boundaries

### Implementation Details
- Created Error Boundary component to catch and gracefully handle runtime errors
- Implemented sectioned error boundaries to isolate failures to specific components
- Added retry functionality to recover from errors without full page refresh

### Benefits
- Prevents entire application crashes when a component fails
- Isolates errors to specific sections of the application
- Improves user experience with dedicated error UI and recovery options
- Enables better error monitoring and debugging

### Usage Example
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary section="Activity Log">
  <ActivityLogSection />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## 4. Component Optimizations

### Implementation Details
- Added useCallback for function stability and preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented memo for complex child components
- Added proper typing for improved type safety
- Used native lazy loading for images
- Added proper cleanup functions in useEffect hooks

### Benefits
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Better memory management
- Improved type safety
- Better scroll performance

## Best Practices

1. **Data Fetching**
   - Always use the `useDataFetching` hook for API calls
   - Provide appropriate cache keys and durations based on data update frequency
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Use lazy loading for large components or infrequently used features
   - Ensure proper loading states are shown during component loading
   - Group related components in the same chunk when appropriate

3. **Error Handling**
   - Wrap logical sections of the application in ErrorBoundary components
   - Provide meaningful error messages and recovery options
   - Log errors appropriately for monitoring

4. **Component Structure**
   - Use useCallback for event handlers and functions passed to child components
   - Implement memo for components that receive complex props
   - Add cleanup functions to all useEffect hooks that set state or subscribe to events

## Future Improvements

- Implement virtualized lists for extremely large datasets
- Add service worker for offline capabilities
- Implement proper WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Add comprehensive performance monitoring
